## Project

**boardown** is a small open-source task board that stores its data as markdown
files inside the project repo. It is aimed at solo developers and follows a
lightweight scrum flow: a Backlog plus releases with a `future → current →
finished` lifecycle, and epics as a cross-release grouping that doubles as
the storage container for unscheduled tasks. The product spec lives in
[PRODUCT.md](./PRODUCT.md) — read it before making non-trivial changes.

## Communication rules

- Write all code, comments, identifiers, commit messages, and documentation in
  **English**.
- When replying to the user in chat, **reply in the same language the user
  wrote in**. Do not translate the user's message just to process it — answer
  in their language directly.

## Tech stack (decided)

- **Language:** TypeScript (strict mode everywhere)
- **Frontend framework:** React 18
- **Build tool:** Vite
- **Package manager / monorepo:** pnpm with workspaces
- **State management:** Zustand (kept minimal — single-user app, no Redux)
- **Schema validation:** Zod (frontmatter + config)
- **Markdown frontmatter:** `gray-matter`
- **Drag & drop:** `@dnd-kit/core`
- **Tests:** Vitest

The primary distribution channel is a **VS Code extension** (packaged into an
installable `.vsix` and published to the Marketplace and Open VSX), which reads
`.boardown/` from the open workspace, alongside the Electron desktop app and the
CLI. The **browser shell (`packages/web`) is a development and
local-from-sources tool** — it boots `@boardown/ui` against a selected
`.boardown/` over a Vite middleware, and is not a distribution channel. It has
no folder picker and no File System Access API integration. The same package
also carries **`boardown-web`**, a local HTTP server that serves the built UI
over those same endpoints, for one board or for several listed in a registry
file; it is installed from a tarball packed on the machine that runs it, so
nothing about it reaches a registry either.

`@boardown/core` and `@boardown/ui` are both consumed source-only:
`main`/`exports` point at `src/index.ts`, no separate build step. The shell's
bundler (Vite for `web`, esbuild for the VS Code host) transpiles them, and
`tsc`/ESLint resolve their types straight from source. Neither package emits a
`dist/`. Only the shells (`web`, `vscode`, `electron`, `cli`) have a `build`
script — they bundle the source-only libraries into their own artifacts.

`packages/vscode` is the primary distribution target. It is a sibling shell next
to `web` and reuses `@boardown/ui` unchanged — only the `FsAdapter`
implementation and entry flow differ. The extension host is bundled with esbuild (`vscode` external, CJS) and
the webview with Vite; both run in the Extension Development Host via F5. The
webview mounts the real `@boardown/ui` with a `VsCodeFsAdapter` that proxies
`read/write/list/stat` to the host over `postMessage`, where the host serves
them from `vscode.workspace.fs`. The board root is the single open workspace
folder's `.boardown/`; choosing among multiple roots or an arbitrary folder is
out of scope (Electron territory). The Electron desktop build follows the same
shell pattern and ships installers with each release.

`packages/web` owns one set of HTTP endpoints — `/api/fs/{read,list,stat,write,
mkdir,remove}` scoped to a board root, the read-only `/api/project-file` scoped to
the project folder around it, and `/api/events`, the stream a browser tab holds
open to hear that its board changed — and two hosts for them. The Vite
middleware serves them for the dev shell; `boardown-web` serves them for a
locally installed server, where they sit under `/b/<id>/` when a registry lists
several boards. What they share lives in one module (`src/api/`), so the two can
never drift into two implementations of the same rule: the per-request handlers,
given a root per request by whichever host is running, and next to them the watch
hub, which is long-lived instead — each host builds one at startup and hands it
down the same way it hands down a root, and a host that is not watching
(`--no-watch`) builds none, which is the whole of what the flag does. The browser
side talks to them through `HttpFsAdapter` and `HttpProjectFileReader`, which take
the endpoint base and so follow the prefix. Which tab is asking is a fact about the
request rather than an argument of the operation, so it rides in a header
(`X-Boardown-Client`) — and on the stream, which cannot send one, in a query
parameter — leaving the `/api/fs/*` bodies the operation's own arguments. The two
roots stay apart on purpose: no write path is ever handed the project root. This is
the **only** browser-side path — it is the working environment for `@boardown/ui`
development, not a stepping stone to a deployable browser app.

Next to those, `boardown-web` in registry mode serves `/api/projects/{add,remove}`,
which the list page's inline script calls. They are a **third** root: the only file
they write is the registry the server was started on — no board and no project
folder is ever a write target — which is why they sit outside `/b/<id>/`, live in
`src/server/` rather than the shared `src/api/`, and exist in no other mode. They
do *read* outside it: a folder is stat'd before it is registered, and each row's
name comes from that project's own `config.yaml`. The registry is patched as text —
one line in or out, the rest of the file including its comments untouched — and
every patch is re-parsed and compared against what the edit meant before it is
allowed to land, so a file shape the patcher misreads becomes a refusal instead of
a corrupted registry.

`packages/cli` is a headless shell that does **not** mount `@boardown/ui` — it has
no DOM. Instead it consumes `@boardown/core` directly (board-ops, loader,
serializer, schemas) and implements `FsAdapter` over `node:fs/promises`, mapping
CLI commands onto board operations. It is aimed at agents and scripts: output is a
stable JSON envelope when stdout is not a TTY (or with `--json`), human-readable
otherwise. The bin is bundled with esbuild into a single Node CJS file. Process
invariants (release lifecycle, finished-release read-only) live in `core`, so the
CLI inherits them rather than re-implementing them.

## Conventions

- Keep `packages/core` free of any UI / browser / VS Code imports. It must be
  consumable from React, an extension host, or Node.
- Keep `packages/ui` free of platform-specific imports too: no `window.*`,
  `document.*`, `navigator.*` outside what works in any DOM host (browser
  tab, VS Code webview, Electron renderer); no Node, no `vscode` API. The
  `FsAdapter` and any other platform capabilities arrive via props/context
  from the shell.
- Shells (`web`, future `vscode`, `electron`) own platform integrations:
  `FsAdapter` implementation, folder picker / workspace acquisition, refresh
  triggers, OS dialogs.
- All access to the **board** goes through the `FsAdapter` interface defined in
  `packages/core`, rooted at `.boardown/` by every shell. Two capabilities sit
  outside it, both declared in `core` and both **read-only**: `ProjectFileReader`,
  scoped to the project folder, which repo file links use to preview a file from
  the repo, and `GitHistoryReader`, scoped to the Git repository around that
  folder, which the task dialog's Commits panel reads. Each is deliberately a
  separate interface rather than a method on `FsAdapter` — the adapter is what the
  conflict guard wraps and what every write goes through, and no write path may
  reach outside `.boardown/`. A new file-touching feature belongs on `FsAdapter`
  unless it is read-only *and* needs the project folder. Never call `fetch`, `fs`,
  or browser APIs from `core` or `ui`.
- **A host capability whose result is a *decision* keeps that decision in `core`,
  behind an injected primitive; the host supplies only the syscall.** Git is the
  worked example: `readTaskCommits` in `core` owns the argv, the exit-code chain
  that separates "no repository" from "an empty one", the output parsing and the
  token match, and each of the four Node hosts (VS Code extension host, Electron
  main, `web`'s shared handler, the CLI) passes it a `run` callback of about
  fifteen lines around `execFile`. A rule spread across four hosts drifts
  invisibly — one shell reporting Git unavailable where another reports no
  repository is a bug nobody sees — while a copy of the spawn itself fails
  loudly. Same split as `classifyProjectFile`, which classifies bytes each host
  reads for itself.
- Validate every parsed `frontmatter` and `config.yaml` through a Zod schema.
  Surface validation errors as structured problems (see "Lenient parsing"
  in PRODUCT.md), never throw away user data.
- Never auto-rewrite a file the parser failed to fully understand.
- A write must never re-sort the task blocks of a file. A container's `tasks`
  array is the file's block order, so a board operation returns it in the order
  it received it — new tasks are appended, and everything else is patched in
  place. Sorting is the reader's job (`sortTasksByOrder` / `unscheduledTasks`);
  a list that skips it shows whatever the markdown happens to look like. This is
  what keeps a status change a two-line diff that merges across git branches.
- If `.boardown/config.yaml` is missing, the UI shows an onboarding modal
  that writes it on submit. Do not auto-create `config.yaml` outside that
  flow, and do not fall back to defaults — a present-but-invalid config is
  always an error, never silently replaced.
- No automated backups — git is the safety net.
- Write safety: `ui` wraps the `FsAdapter` in `createGuardedFs`
  (`packages/core`), which refuses a write that would lose data, on two rules
  checked in that order. **Unreadable target:** the guard holds the load's parse
  problems, and a target carrying an error-level one is refused with an
  `UnreadableFileError` — the block the parser could not read is not in the model,
  so writing the file back would drop it. **External change:** it compares each
  write target's `lastModified` against the value captured at load and refuses to
  clobber a file changed on disk. Each refusal calls its own callback before it
  throws, which is how a shell with no access to the write's call site puts
  something on screen: the UI opens the "File cannot be written" modal for the
  first and the Reload conflict modal for the second, the CLI throws
  `UNREADABLE_FRONTMATTER` and `CONFLICT`. Both modals close every other dialog, so
  no two ever stack in the top layer. Shared by all shells — a new rule about what
  may be written belongs in the guard, not in a shell. The guard also
  exposes `writeAll`, for a set of files that must land together (e.g. a task link
  mirrored into two tasks): it checks every target before writing any of them, so
  an external change aborts the whole operation instead of half-applying it —
  reach for it in any new multi-file mutation. `moveFile` is the same idea for a
  file that changes its name (a renamed release): it checks the source and refuses
  a target that already exists, then writes the new path and removes the old one,
  undoing the copy if the removal fails. Deletion is guarded the same way:
  `remove` checks the target first, and `removeAll` checks every file beneath a
  directory before removing it, so deleting a docs folder is all-or-nothing —
  though the unreadable rule does not apply to a deletion, which is deliberate and
  total rather than a silent partial loss. Re-reading on
  demand is the manual Reload button; in addition every shell auto-refreshes on
  external `.boardown/` changes via a host file watcher — gated by the
  `boardown.autoRefresh` setting in VS Code and Electron, and by `--no-watch` on
  `boardown-web`, while the Vite dev shell is always on. All three deliver it the
  same way: the host debounces a burst, drops the echo of its own writes, and the
  UI side calls the store's `reloadSilent()`.
- Logging goes through the logger in `packages/core` (`createLogger`), never
  `console.*` — ESLint enforces `no-console` across `packages/**` source. Build
  and dev scripts (`*.mjs`) are exempt: their output is ordinary tool output.
  The logger is a no-op until a shell installs a sink, and **only the `web` dev
  shell does** (a per-run file under `logs/` at the repo root, plus the lines the
  browser forwards to it). Electron installs a stderr sink for its bootstrap crash
  and nothing else; VS Code and the CLI install none. A shipped shell emitting log
  output to a user is a bug, not a feature.
- **When to add a log line.** The rule is *what a developer needs to reconstruct a
  session from the file alone*, not "log everything interesting".
  - `error` — a failure the user is shown, or one that is swallowed. In
    `packages/ui` these are already covered: the store logs every transition of
    `errorMessage`, so a new `catch` that sets it needs **no** log call. Add one
    by hand only where a failure never reaches `errorMessage`.
  - `info` — a user action, or a change that lands on disk. Actions in the store
    are covered automatically by the wrapper around its `set`/actions at creation,
    so a new store action needs no log call either. A **new write path outside the
    store** does need one.
  - `debug` — individual reads and other per-request chatter. Fine to add freely;
    it is off in any narrowed level.
  - Do not log inside render, inside a loop over board items, or on every
    keystroke. Do not log file *contents*, and remember lines carry absolute paths
    and user text — the file is local and gitignored, but it is not a secrets vault.
  - `packages/core` and `packages/ui` may import `createLogger`, never a sink.
    Choosing a destination is the shell's job.
- A dialog that wants the caret in a field **when it opens** marks that field
  `data-autofocus`, and `Modal` focuses it right after `showModal()`. React's
  `autoFocus` does **not** work there: react-dom calls `focus()` at mount, while
  the `<dialog>` is still closed and nothing inside it is focusable, and the
  browser then falls back to the first focusable element — the header ✕. A dialog
  that declares nothing keeps that fallback, which is how a dialog opts out. This
  is about focus at open only; a field mounted later into an already-open dialog
  is an ordinary `autoFocus`.
- Styling in `packages/ui`: CSS variables for the theme palette (defined in
  `src/theme/theme.css`, scoped via `:root, [data-theme='light']`, etc.) and
  CSS Modules for component-specific styles (`Foo.module.css`). Components
  must reference colors/typography only through `var(--…)` — never hard-code
  hex values — so a new theme is one extra `[data-theme='dark'] { … }` block.
  No CSS-in-JS, no Tailwind.
- TypeScript: prefer `interface` for public shapes, `type` for unions/utility
  types. No `any`. No non-null assertions unless unavoidable and commented.
- Comments: only when the *why* is non-obvious. Do not narrate what the code
  does. No multi-paragraph docstrings.
- No premature abstractions. Three similar lines is fine; do not generalise on
  speculation.
- No backwards-compatibility shims while the project is pre-1.0. Just change
  the code.
- boardown dog-foods its own board, stored in `.boardown/`. A change that
  touches **only** board data — grooming, reordering, a release edited by hand —
  is committed under the `chore(board): …` scope, which
  `scripts/generate-release-notes.mjs` excludes from generated release notes, so
  bookkeeping never leaks into a user-facing changelog. When board data changes
  **because of the code in the same change** — a task moved to done by the work
  that did it — it belongs in that same commit under its normal
  conventional-commit type: the task is the record of the change, and a commit
  that leaves it behind describes work its own board says never happened.
- Versioning is **lockstep**: every `package.json` carries the same version,
  with the **root `package.json` as the single source of truth**. Never bump a
  package version by hand — use `pnpm release:prepare` (which mirrors the root
  version into all packages via `scripts/sync-versions.mjs`, and for a stable
  version seeds a draft `docs/release-notes/v<version>.md`). It does **not**
  commit: curate the notes and the VS Code Marketplace docs, then land the bump
  and those docs in a single `chore(release): v<version>` commit. The workflow
  publishes the notes file verbatim when present, else generates from the commit
  log. Releases are cut by bumping the version on `main`; the `Release` workflow tags and attaches
  the built `.vsix` and desktop installers to a GitHub Release, then calls the
  reusable per-target `publish-*.yml` workflows: `publish-marketplace.yml`
  (VS Code Marketplace) and `publish-openvsx.yml` (Open VSX) publish the `.vsix`,
  and `publish-npm.yml` publishes the CLI package (`@grinev/boardown-cli`) to npm
  via tokenless Trusted Publishing (OIDC). See [README](./README.md#releasing).

## Verifying changes

Before considering any code change done, run these from the repo root and make
sure they pass (they are the same gates CI enforces):

- `pnpm lint` — ESLint over the whole repo.
- `pnpm typecheck` — `tsc --noEmit` across all packages.
- `pnpm build` — `pnpm -r build`; builds the shells (`web`, `vscode`). The
  source-only libraries (`core`, `ui`) have no `build` script and are skipped.
- `pnpm test` — Vitest across all packages.

Order does not matter: `core` and `ui` are source-only, so `lint`/`typecheck`
resolve their types from source and never depend on a prior build.

### Browser testing

There is deliberately **no e2e suite** — it would cost more to maintain than it
returns on a project this size. When a UI change needs to be exercised in a real
browser, **delegate it to the `manual-tester` agent**
(`.claude/agents/manual-tester.md`): it owns the Playwright MCP tools, the sandbox
board and the discipline that goes with them, and it keeps a whole browser
transcript out of the context of whoever is writing the code. Hand it the feature
and the acceptance criteria; it drives, breaks and reports.

Do not drive the browser yourself. A change that looks trivial ("just swapped two
sections") is exactly the one that gets checked by hand, badly, and burns the
context you still need for the work.

Every dev-server run writes a log file to `logs/` at the repo root (gitignored),
named for the run's start time. It holds the user-action trail, every write to the
board and every failure on either side — read it when a UI problem is hard to see
from the screen alone, and attach it to a bug report. See "Logging" under
Conventions for what goes in it.

The sandbox (`pnpm dev:sandbox`, port 5199) serves a **throwaway copy** of
`tests/fixtures/board/.boardown/`. Never point a browser session or a CLI run at
the repo's own `.boardown/` — every click writes markdown to disk, and you would
corrupt the real board.

Writing UI code with testing in mind: elements without an accessible name (board
column, task card, backlog row, section) carry `data-testid`; everything else is
reachable via role/label. If a new element needs neither, prefer giving it a
proper accessible name over a testid.

Run the full set as part of a task's Definition of Done; a green local run is
expected before committing. If a change is scoped to one package you may iterate
with `pnpm --filter @boardown/<pkg> <script>`, but do a full-repo
`pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm build` before wrapping up. Never commit
code that fails any of these gates.

## Working style

- Stay strictly within the scope the user asked for. If a task surfaces
  related questions, raise them — do not silently expand the work.
- Surface architectural choices and any non-trivial trade-offs before
  implementing them. Do not silently pick a "sensible default" for things
  like library choice, module boundaries, data formats, or edge-case
  behaviour. Trivial implementation details (local variable names, import
  order, etc.) do not need to be confirmed.
- The product is intentionally small. Push back on feature creep.
- **Never commit without explicit permission.** Do not run `git commit` (or
  `git push`) on your own initiative, even when a change is finished and the
  gates pass. Stage and prepare changes if asked, but wait for the user to
  explicitly tell you to commit. **Unless the command you are running states its
  own commit rule:** a non-interactive flow has nobody to ask, so it carries the
  conditions instead, and under such a command you follow those. `git push` is
  never covered by that exception.

## Planning

boardown dog-foods its own board: releases, epics and tasks live in
[`.boardown/`](./.boardown/) and are the single source of truth for what is
planned and what is done. Read the board (or drive it with the CLI) instead of
looking for a checklist in a markdown doc.

[PRODUCT.md](./PRODUCT.md) describes what the product *is* — domain model,
storage format, behaviour rules, shells — plus a broad "Direction" section. It
is descriptive, not a contract: when a change makes it inaccurate, update it.
